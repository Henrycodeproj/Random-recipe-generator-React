# A random recipe generator.
This app will use themealdb api to get recipes and will allow users to save it in a list so they can come back and look for it at anytime. It allows users to scroll and explore new possible recipes and will allow them to search by category if they want something specific. This app was made for me to practice using react more and to explore react animation libraries like framer motion and using Material UI for styling.
